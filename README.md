# HR-Analytics
The objective of this project was to assist and provide valuable insights to HR professionals by creating a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard helping to understand why employees leave , identify trends enabling them to make informed decisions and developing strategies to reduce employee attrition rates.







## About Dataset

 
The dataset is provided by @MeriSKILL during my internship as a Data Analyst intern.

 The data is provided in CSV format.
This dataset make up 35 relevant features which includes information such as age,attrition, Business travel ,education etc.

 



 

## Dashboard Created 

The Dashboard is created in Power BI Desktop which consist of several reports such as Demographics , Turnover Analysis I , Turnover Analysis II , Employee Wellness which will help the company determine what action they will need to take to retain more employees.
The analysis of the employee data involves creation of calculated measures and columns using Power Query and DAX in Power BI. It also involves plotting correlation map (Heatmap) using Python visual for all numeric variables of the dataset to identify the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. In this dashboard, grouping plays a crucial role in organizing and presenting the data effectively. The design of the dashboard is tailored to utilize the power of grouping for enhanced data visualization and analysis.
